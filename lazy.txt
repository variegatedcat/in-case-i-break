stuff you have to do manually:

set "apparmor=1 security=apparmor" in kernel parameters


enable ccache in /etc/makepkg.conf


install steam and game stuff

get ungoogled-chromium-bin if you need to use webhid and stuff


if /home wasnt kept:

otd should have 52 size in top left

set up git

theme everything (if you are me then clone https://github.com/variegatedcat/dots.git)

set up librewolf
